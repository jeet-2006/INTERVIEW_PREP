BST: root node is alway greater than left childrean and always less then right childrean.

*BST FACTS*

==> for above example left childrean should be less then 20 and right should be greater than 20.
==> In BST insert, delete and search operation will take log(n) time.
==> When we performs inOrder traversal in BST it will always sorted.
    if we consider above example inOrder traversal = 5 10 15 20 25.



Q: when to use Tree?
A: When we want some data in particular range. like 10 to 30
A: when we want data in structural format.
